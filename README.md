# Pathfinding_visualizer
A visualizer for pathfinding algorithms, the first that i implemented is A*. 
Dependencies:
To run the code you will need at least a python version >= 3.8, and install the pygame library, what can be done with the command "pip install pygame"

To actually run the code you just need to enter the project directory and then run the following command: python3 main.py
This will open a pygame window with a grid. The first click with the left mouse button on a cell will place the start, the second will place the end, and the rest will place the walls. If you click with the right mouse button on a cell with the start, end or a wall, you erase it and you can place it again clicking again with the left button.
Once you have all in place you can run the algorithm with the space key. And if you want to clean the board to test it again without closing the window, you can use the c key.
